Disclaimer: This implementation truncates the trailing block of 64 bits. Do not use this software on sensitive data.

An implementation of the DES (Data Encryption Standard) specification. This cryptography method is out-dated, and has been replaced with the Triple Data Encryption Standard, or TDES. Full TDES implementation is the goal of this project.

Usage: tdes [-enc|-dec] <source> <dest>

After building with GNU make, run the executable with the stated arguments. The key is built in and is only customizable by altering the source code. 

Recommended: Use the tdes tool to encrypt the provided text file located at data/bee_movie_script. Again, use the tool to decrypt the destination file to demonstrate the encryption -> decryption life-cycle.
