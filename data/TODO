### TO-DO: TDES ###
 - Multithreading for concurrent encryption/decryption
 - Lower memory cost: read and write x number of bytes at a time
 - Rid magic numbers with preprocessor defines
 - Mode of Operation (confidentiality and authenticity)
    - Message authentication code?
    - Initialization vector
    - Chaining / Feedback
    - Padding on last block
 - Metadata insertion (authentication & integrity data, algorithm, mode of operation, version) 
 - Checksum at EOF to validate successful encryption/decryption
 - Increase progress status accuracy by including read, write, and key generation
 - Performance testing. Compare with other implementations and optimize
 - Documentation with Doxygen
 - Consider building as a <popular *nix package manager> package.
 - Cross-platform compatible with Windows and OSX
 - Implement header file for use as a library

### DONE ###
 - Fix 64 bit truncation at EOF
 - Full TDES implementation DES -> TDES
